# Potato Health Classification and Disease Detection

A deep learning project that utilizes TensorFlow to identify healthy potatoes and detect diseases such as early and late blight. The system is supported by a FastAPI backend for efficient image processing and real-time diagnostics.

## Features

- **Disease Classification**: Detects and classifies potato health status into healthy, early blight, or late blight categories.  
- **Real-Time Diagnostics**: Provides instant feedback by analyzing potato images using a FastAPI-powered backend.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Combines TensorFlow's robust neural network capabilities with FastAPI's high-performance API framework.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Framework**: TensorFlow  
- **Backend Framework**: FastAPI  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Data Input**: Images of potatoes
